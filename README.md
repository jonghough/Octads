# Octads

The S(5,8,24) Steiner System is a combinatorial object, built on 24 points, with subsets of 8 points, called octads, such that no 5 points exist in more than one octad. There are 759 such octads.

## Automorphisms
The automorphism group is M24, which is a sporadic simple group.

## Miracle Octad Generator
The MOG is a system for quickly finding octads. [mog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_Octad_Generator)


# Heaxads

The S(5,6,12) Steiner System is also a combinatorial object, built on 12 points, with subsets of 6 points, called hexads, such that no 5 points exist in more than one hexad. There are 132 hexads.

## Automorphisms
The automorphism group is M12, which is a subgroup of M24.

## Kitten
The Kitten is an analogous tool to the MOG, for finding hexads easily in S(5,6,12).
